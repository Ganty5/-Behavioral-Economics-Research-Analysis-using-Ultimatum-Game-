Güth, Schmittberger, and Schwarze (1982) developed the ultimatum game in reaction to their observations of individuals "leaving money on the table" in intricate multi-round talks when they rejected offers. The economists' response was to examine a very basic game with a single offer
since it shows a stark contrast between the rules of self-serving, calculated behavior and ideas of justice. The proposer should be able to get away with making a very small offer to the respondent if all that matters to people is their income.The ultimatum game accentuates the tension 
between fairness considerations, altruism, punishments, and negotiation strategies, all essential elements of human social interactions. A certain amount of money is given to one player, the proposer, who then has to propose to the other player, the responder, how to divide it up. 
Most importantly, the responder has the authority to approve or disapprove the proposer's offer. If it is approved, each player gets their designated portion; if it is denied, neither player gets anything. Because one player initiates movement first and the players employ various sets of 
strategies, this game is both sequential and asymmetric. The tendency of responders to reject unjust offers, even at personal expense, makes the ultimatum game so fascinating. This tendency challenges conventional economic theories that are based only on rational self-interest. This
phenomenon throws light on altruism, inequality aversion, and the evolution of cooperation while highlighting the complexity of human decision-making 

RESEARCH QUESTION
1. How much do proposers offer (in %)?
2. What is the acceptance behavior of responders as a function of offers?
3. Can the Fehr-Schmidt inequality aversion model explain the responder’s acceptance behavior? If yes, what is the estimated corresponding inequality aversion parameter? (𝛼)
4. How does the offers' size affect responders' acceptance rate?
5. Since our database comes from classroom experiments: are behaviors under this condition similar to behaviors in standard lab experiments?

The significance of studying the Ultimatum game lies in its ability to reveal deviations from the traditional economic model of rational self-interest, suggesting that human behaviors are often influenced by social preferences and norms. According to the conventional economic
paradigm, respondents must accept any positive offer made by the proposer as long as it is more than zero (Rubinstein, 1982). Comprehending the behavior of individuals in economic settings is crucial for researchers, corporations, and politicians alike. 

LITERATURE 
Over the years, Ultimatum Game research has yielded many behavioral discoveries. Important conclusions consist of the outlined literature:
1. Fairness and Altruism: Proposers usually offer between 40 and 50 percent of the total, whereas respondents frequently reject proposals that fall between 20 and 30 percent. This
indicates that fairness and altruism are important factors in decision-making. (Güth et al., 1982; Fehr & Schmidt, 1999).

2. Cultural Differences: Research has revealed notable differences in Ultimatum Game behavior between cultures. Henrich et al. (2005) discovered that offers and rejection rates were greatly varied between 15 small-scale communities, indicating that socialization and
cultural norms have a major impact on how fairness is perceived.

3. Offer Sizes: It has also been discovered in research the effect of offer sizes on players’ behavior, especially the responders. It has been shown that higher stakes decrease the frequency of rejections but the fundamental pattern of fair offers endures showing deeply
rooted fairness concerns (Andersen et al., 2011).

4. Reputation and Repeated Encounters: Studies have demonstrated that the possibility of reputation effects and repeated encounters result in more tolerant replies and generous offers, underscoring the significance of future implications when making decisions (Roth
et al., 1991; Bolton & Zwick, 1995).

Regression Analysis: 
A regression analysis was carried out on the ultimatum Game experiment dataset. This analysis will help us understand the relationship between certain variables displayed in our dataset, such as the relationship between offers and different years for round 1, final round,
and mean offers, taking into account explanatory variables such as Gender, and dummy variables (2021, 2020 and 2019/16). The dataset of 2019 was merged with 2016 to enable us to capture better insights into players' behaviours before the pandemic. Using a linear regression model, 
we aim to determine the extent the variance in the rounds and mean offers can be explained. Python tool aided the performance of this analysis and the importation of some essential libraries also enhanced this analysis. Libraries such as Pandas, Stasmodels, and Scikit-learn. 
Pandas is a Python library that aids data analysis and manipulation. It is used effectively for the importation and loading of datasets of different formats into the IDE.

Three regression analyses were carried out. The controlled variables were Round 1, Final round, and mean offers. For each regression, we presented regression with and without the gender
variable.

Model 1: Focus on Round 1 (with and without the gender variable)
• 𝑂𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑡𝑜 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑠1 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1(𝑌2021) + 𝛽1(𝑌2020) + 𝛽1(𝑌201916) + 𝜀1
• 𝑂𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑡𝑜 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑠1 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1(𝑌2021) + 𝛽1(𝑌2020) + 𝛽1(𝑌201916) + 𝛽2𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟 + 𝜀1

To perform this regression, Python was used and the procedure involved:
1. Identify the dependent and independent variables as shown in Model 1
2. Importing the data as shown in Appendix 1.1
3. Perform the OLS regression for each case as presented

OLS Regression Analysis on Responder Decision: 
The dataset recorded an issue of
multicollinearity and perfect separation, precisely on the dummy variables as there were nan outputs on the result generated for z-values, coefficients, and standard error for dummy year variables, thus the use of Probit regression had limitations in producing the best results. Using the
OLS regression model shown in Appendix 2.0, we aim to analyze the determinants of the responder's response (accept =1 or reject = 0). It is essential to understand the factors likely to influence the responder’s decision to accept or reject an offer from the proposers, this is crucial for
insights into human behavior, fairness, and strategies. In this regression, the dependent variable is a binary response (response(value) derived from the dataset using Excel. The key independentvariable is the Offers to Responders followed by some additional dummy variables for year
variables. The OLS regression model enables the modeling of binary outcome variables. With this model, we can provide insights into how changes in the offer sizes and specific year experiments influence the acceptance decision of responders. The analysis is conducted across 10 rounds. The
OLS regression analysis would be carried out with consideration of gender and without gender for all rounds.

Model 1: Focus on the Decision of Responders (without gender) for 10 rounds
Where 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒(𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒) 𝑖 =1 for acceptance, 0 for rejection
• 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒(𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒)𝑖 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝑂𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑡𝑜 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖 + 𝑌_2021𝑖 + 𝑌_2020𝑖 + 𝑌_201916𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖

Model 2: Focus on the Decision of responders (with gender) for 10 rounds
• 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒(𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒)𝑖 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝑂𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑡𝑜 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖 + 𝑌_2021𝑖 + 𝑌_2020𝑖 + 𝑌_201916𝑖 + 𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖
